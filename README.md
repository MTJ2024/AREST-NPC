  SetWantedOnCrime = true,              -- Set wanted level when committing crimes
  SetWantedOnPoliceDetection = true,    -- Set wanted level when police detect you
  DefaultWantedLevel = 2,               -- Default wanted level when auto-generated
  MinWantedLevel = 2,                   -- Minimum wanted level for arrest scenario

2. **Police Response** - NPCs spawn at 2+ stars, roadblocks at 3+, helicopter at 4+
3. **Surrender Option** - Press [E] to surrender when surrounded
4. **Cinematic Arrest** - Enjoy the enhanced visual effects during arrest
